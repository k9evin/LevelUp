## 📁 Project Structure

Here’s a quick look at how things are organized in LevelUp:

- **`app/`**: The heart of the app—contains all the main pages and logic.
- **`components/`**: Reusable UI components (because nobody likes to reinvent the wheel).
- **`lib/`**: All your handy utility functions and libraries.
- **`public/`**: Static assets like images, icons, and other goodies.
- **`styles/`**: Global and component-specific styles to make everything look sharp.

### 🎨 Custom Fonts

We're all about that slick UI. LevelUp uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to load and optimize **Inter**, a custom Google Font, for smooth visuals.
